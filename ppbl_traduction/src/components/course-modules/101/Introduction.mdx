# Introduction to Module 101: 

"This is a plutus script. There are many ways to create a plutus script. 

Depending on your goals as a developer, you'll take different approaches. 

If you want to be a Smart Contract developer, we strongly recommend getting nix set up. Or do we! That's the question for Sunday/Monday

If you want to build applications, maybe you just need to make friends with a SC dev. 

Either way, this course is designed to help you understand how Cardano works, so that you can start building. 

In this module, we will survey some approaches to building plutus scripts, and then in Module 102 and beyond, you'll start to see how to use them."
