## Outcome: Extract the blue transaction box at `/metadatatx` to its own component.

Here is a task for someone who knows a bit of ReactJS, wants to get to know this project and can start contributing.

In the project repo https://gitlab.com/jamesdunseith/gimbal-tracker, look for `/src/pages/metadatatx.js`. Create a new component in `/src/components` called `TxForm` that extracts the blue box starting on line 197 of `metdatatx.js`.

Please pay close attention to including the right helper functions.
